### Classic question solved using Two-pointers. Inspired by the solution at the following link:

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        max_V = 0 
        left,right = 0,n-1
        while left < right:
            
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                V = (right -left) * height[left]
                left +=1
            else:
                V = (right -left) * height[right]
                right -=1
                
            max_V = max(V,max_V)
            
        return max_V
