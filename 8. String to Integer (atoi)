### The edge case is kinda stupid, one of which is "  +  413". To me it is obvious that the expected outome will be 413 but the answer asks for 0.

class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        symbol = '+'
        symbol_count = 0
        number = ''  
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == ' ' and number == '' and symbol_count == 0:
                pass
            elif s[i] in ('+','-') and number == '':
                symbol = s[i]
                symbol_count +=1
                if symbol_count >=2:
                    return 0
            elif s[i] in '0123456789':
                number += s[i]
                
            else:
                break
        
        if number == '':
            return 0
        else:
            if symbol == '-':
                number = -int(number)

            else:
                number = int(number)
            
        if number > 2**31 -1:
            return 2**31 -1
        elif number < -2**31:
            return -2**31
        return number
