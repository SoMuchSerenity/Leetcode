A quick and good solution by others at the following link.
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/discuss/1624031/Simple-Python-solution-44ms
Mine is rather memory saving but quite slow.


class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        node = 0
        max_length = 0
        longest = ''
        for j in range(len(s)-1):
            for i in range(j,len(s)-1):
                if s[i+1] in s[node:i+1]:
                    length = i+1 - node
                    if length > max_length:
                        max_length = length
                        longest = s[node:i+1]
                    node  = j+1
                    break


        if len(s) -node > len(longest):
            longest = s[node:]
        return len(longest)
